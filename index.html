  <p><b>1-. A medium of exchange in economic transactions:</b> Money, created and distributed in physical or digital form by countries is known as <b style="color:red;">currency</b>. Currency is a medium of exchange for <b style="color:red;">goods</b> and <b style="color:red;">services</b>. The United Nations recognized around 180 currencies across the world. The United States dollar is the current reserve currency of the world. Foreign-exchange <b style="color:red;">markets</b> are used to trade exchange rates between two national currencies,</p>

<p><b>2-. A method of payment:</b> The immediate payment of a buy or sell is known as a <b style="color:red;">cash currency transaction</b>. Goods or services obtained and paid later are known as <b style="color:red;">credit transactions</b>. The <b style="color:red;">buyer</b> on a credit transaction is known as <b style="color:red;">debtor</b> and the <b style="color:red;">seller</b> is known as <b style="color:red;">creditor</b>. The first day after a debtor misses a payment date, the debtor transaction becomes past due, or <b style="color:red;">delinquent</b>.</p>

<p><b>3-. A unit of account:</b> Money is <b style="color:red;">countable</b>, <b style="color:red;">divisible</b>, and <b style="color:red;">fungible</b>. Countable because it is used to value goods and services and account for <b style="color:red;">profits</b> and <b style="color:red;">losses</b> or <b style="color:red;">credits</b> and <b style="color:red;">debits</b>. To facilitate exchange, money should be divisible to a unit of currency broken down into smaller units. Each unit is fungible, meaning no currency unit of the same type is unique or special and they are all fully interchangeable. For example, there are 5 coins denomination in the US Dollar currency: 1) Penny (valued at 1 cent), 2) Nickel (worth 5 cents), 3) Dime (worth 10 cents), 4) Quarter (worth 25 cents), 5) Dollar (worth 100 cents).</p>

<p><b>4-. A store of value:</b> The ideal money is the one that <b style="color:red;">preserves its value overtime</b>. It does not <b style="color:red;">depreciate</b>.</p>

<pre><code>For much of his career and life, Beethoven was struggling financially. He would on occasion make a shedload of money, which he tended to invest in bank shares. However, the severe depreciation of the Austrian currency as a result of the extended Napoleonic war, slashed his wealth by over fifty percent, and it also significantly reduced the value of the annuity paid to him by Archduke Rudolph, and the Princes Lobkowitz and Kinsky.

<pre><code>During his lifetime, Prince amassed a fortune estimated at more than $300 million. Many believe that his tragic death on April 21, 2016, might prove to be even more lucrative for his heirs.
As his fans now know, the enigmatic artist left behind a vast trove of unreleased songs locked in a vault. It took more than a year to get the vault unlocked, but it is now paying off handsomely for the Prince estate.  Prince was the first artist to sell albums directly to the fans on the Internet.

Crisiero had no knowledge of fig­ures, so it was very natural that he said, &#34;That is right, patron.&#34;
Don Arnulfo was a decent, honor­ able man. Other landowners were a good deal less softhearted with their peons.
&#34; The shirt is five pesos. Right? Very well. And as you can&#39;t pay for it, that&#39;s five pesos. And as you remain in my debt for the five pesos, that&#39;s five pesos. And as I shall never have the money from you, that&#39;s five pesos. So that makes five and five and five and five. That&#39;s twenty pesos. Agreed?&#34;
&#34;Yes, patron, agreed.&#34;
The peon can get the shirt no­ where else when he needs one. He can get credit nowhere but from his master, for whom he works and from whom he can never get away as long as he owes him a centavo.
